Without `categories: name` FrontMatter, there is no default category.

Without `layout: post` FrontMatter, this default template is the `post` template.

Without `title: none` FrontMatter, the title is the page file name without its extension.

The YYYY-MM-DD date is extracted from the page file name and becomes the path to this post.
