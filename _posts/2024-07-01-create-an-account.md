## TPEN Users by Rerum

The user accounts for TPEN3 will be managed by the [Rerum service](rerum.io) which creates a public User Agent 
for each account.  A user account can register with other Rerum applications and can be linked to other personal identities.

If you have an existing account at t-pen.org in the 2.8 platform, you might consider using the same email address 
to transition with some automation. Our [Migration Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}Migration-Guide) 
will help you with the process.

If you do not have an existing account, you can create a new one.

\* *<small>TPEN practices minimal data collection and you are not required to provide any data beyond what you require for 
effective attribution. User accounts are managed through the Okta service and TPEN does not record anything 
beyond the public Agent record you create. 
You have many options for authentication with Okta(Auth0) and TPEN does not record or share any device ids, 
email addresses, IP addresses, or social media connections you may use to authenticate.
Your contributions are Linked Open Data, but your personal information 
is as private as you leave it.</small>*
