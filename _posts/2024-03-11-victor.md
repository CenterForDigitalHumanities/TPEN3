It is with great pleasure that we welcome new members to the TPEN staff. [Victor Onoja](https://github.com/jsvoo) 
is a student in the Masters of Computer Science program at Saint Louis University. He is 
dedicated to the full-stack development of the TPEN 3.0 upgrade including its services and 
interfaces.

As our team continues to grow, we also want to acknowledge the contributions of our student team 
at the [Open Source with SLU](https://oss-slu.github.io/) <abbr title="Open Source Program Office">OSPO</abbr>. 
While we have not documented all of our contribution guidelines, we also encourage other groups 
to join our efforts to develop this amazing product in the open.
