# T-PEN 3.0

Since our 2.8 release, there have been significant releases of several standards and services whose communities we are part of. [IIIF has released version 3.0](https://twitter.com/iiif_io/status/1142108177133166595?s=20) of the Image and Presentation APIs and [Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/annotation/) is finally in completely open release. Both the open repository at [Rerum.io](https://ongcdh.org/posts/news/rerum-alpha/) and the [Rerum Linked Data Notification Inbox](https://ongcdh.org/posts/development/mirador-and-rerum-inbox-improving-the-ldn-plugin/) have entered public release and been integrated into projects outside the Center.

We have been pushing many updates to TPEN as standards have evolved but it has always happened between other projects and as a patch instead of a redesign. This strange year has given us the opportunity to reevaluate where our effort is being spent and what contributions to scholarship may be most effective. Our software team will be designing and beginning implementation of the next version of our transcription tool in the New Year, integrating the exciting developments across the digital humanities and deciding which aspects of the existing TPEN interface are unhelpful. While we intend to get to everything, we are seeking funding and partners to accelerate development. With this in mind, we are seeking feedback from you to prioritize our efforts.

Please complete this survey (https://forms.gle/sRnGb8V4NgJYxeay9) and let us know what you would like to see. If you would like to collaborate on this effort, be sure to leave your information on the last page. Weâ€™ll post updates on Twitter ([@SLU_CDH](https://twitter.com/SLU_CDH)) and our blog ([ongcdh.org](https://ongcdh.org/)).

Thanks for transcribing!
