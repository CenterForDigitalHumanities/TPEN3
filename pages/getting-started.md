## Core Features for Early Access

### Transcription Interface

The Classic Interface is available first, offering:

- Line-by-line text entry
- Image zoom and navigation
- Auto-save functionality
- Column and layer organization

More interfaces are coming soon for complex layouts and specialized workflows.

### Collaboration

Invite team members and assign roles:

- **Owner** - You, with full control
- **Leader** - Project managers who can configure and invite others
- **Contributor** - Team members who can transcribe
- **Viewer** - Read-only access for reviewers

Access the **Project Management** page to add collaborators.

### Project Organization

- Create **multiple layers** for main text, glosses, and commentary
- Organize pages into **groups** or columns
- Define **text flow** across non-sequential pages
- Add project metadata and license information

---

## Essential Concepts

### Everything is Linked Open Data

Your transcriptions are automatically stored as:
- **Web Annotations** - W3C standard format
- **IIIF Manifests** - Interoperable image structure
- Published to **RERUM** - Public Linked Data repository

This means your work is:
- Immediately accessible to other tools
- Discoverable across the scholarly web
- Yours to export in standard formats

### Non-Destructive Annotation

TPEN 3 never modifies original images. Your transcriptions are:
- Separate annotation layers
- Linked to precise image regions
- Versioned and trackable
- Exportable independently

---

## Common Workflows

### Solo Transcription

1. Create project from image(s) or IIIF Manifest
2. Transcribe at your own pace
3. Export when ready (Plain Text, IIIF, Web Annotation)

### Team Collaboration

1. Owner creates project and invites Leaders
2. Leaders invite Contributors
3. Team transcribes different sections or layers
4. Owner or Leaders export and publish

### Collection Transcription

1. Import entire IIIF Collection
2. Assign different manuscripts to team members
3. Use consistent metadata across projects
4. Export collection-wide
