## The right team, the right tool

Image transcription is a complicated task. As early as the 1990s, the visionaries who imagined the tool sought 
a way to leverage the power of the digital images of medieval manuscripts to accelerate research and encode 
scholarly behavior. As more use cases were accommodated and the tools became more generalized, the TPEN platform 
emerged as a way for scholars, researchers, students, and hobbyists to transcribe and annotate all sorts of 
digitized documents that evaded simple character recognition tools.

### Digital Scholarship at Saint Louis University

TPEN is hosted on servers at [Saint Louis University](https://slu.edu) (SLU) and maintained by developers in the 
Research Computing Group within the Office for the Vice President for Research. Many contributors have supported 
the code, the infrastructure, and the community over the years.

### Legacy

<img alt="old TPEN logo" src="/assets/img/tpen_clearShadowSmall.png" align="right">
The original Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation (T‑PEN) project was coordinated by the 
Center for Digital Theology at [(SLU)](https://slu.edu) and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation and the NEH. The Electronic Norman Anonymous Project developed several capabilities at the core of this 
project's functionality. Dr. Jim Ginther (PI) and Dr. Abigail Firey (co-PI) supervised the team that released the 
first complete platform at t-pen.org in 2010.
